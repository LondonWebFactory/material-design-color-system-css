# Material Design Color System CSS

I love the Material Design Color System, but I hate typing the hexadecimal codes. 

I therefore decided to bite the bullet and spend some time converting the whole color system into CSS variables.

## Usage

Place the code at the head of your CSS file and replace your CSS colors live this:

### Old CSS Code
`border:1px solid #666666;`

### New CSS Code
`border:1px solid var(--gray-600);`

## Example
Check out the attached example.

## Top Tip
I use VS Code and it gives a nice preview swatch of what the color actually looks like.
